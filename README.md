# Spam-Detection

Project Overview
The Spam Detection System is a machine learning-based project designed to identify whether a message is spam or not spam (also called "ham"). It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to clean and prepare the text, and then machine learning algorithms to classify messages. This kind of system is often used in email filtering, messaging apps, or communication systems to block unwanted or harmful messages.

The project covers everything from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation, offering a reliable way to detect spam in a given set of messages.

Key Features
Text Classification: Classifies incoming messages as either spam or ham.
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and processes the text data by removing noise (like stop words, punctuation) and converting text into numerical format.
Machine Learning Model: Employs algorithms like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or other suitable classifiers.
Evaluation Metrics: Includes performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to assess the model's effectiveness.

Dataset
Description
The dataset used in this project is typically a collection of SMS or email messages that have been labeled as either spam or ham. Each message comes with two pieces of information:

Label: Identifies whether the message is spam or ham.
Text: The actual content of the message.

Dataset Source
You can use public datasets such as the SMS Spam Collection Dataset available from UCI Machine Learning Repository or any other relevant datasets.

1.Download the dataset and place it in the data/ folder.
2.Ensure the data is in the correct format (e.g., CSV or JSON).

Data Preprocessing
Before feeding the data into the machine learning model, it needs to be preprocessed:

1.Tokenization: Break down each message into individual words.
2.Lowercasing: Convert all words to lowercase to maintain consistency.
3.Stopword Removal: Remove common words (like "is," "the," "and") that do not add value to the classification task.
4.Stemming/Lemmatization: Reduce words to their base or root form (e.g., "running" becomes "run").
5.Vectorization: Convert text into numerical data using techniques like Bag of Words (BoW) or TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).

Model Training
Once the data is preprocessed, a machine learning model can be trained to detect spam. The training process includes:

Choosing a Model: You can use models like:

Naive Bayes: A common model for text classification due to its simplicity and efficiency.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): A more powerful classifier that works well with complex datasets.
Logistic Regression: Another popular model for binary classification tasks.
Training the Model: The preprocessed text data is split into training and test sets. The model is trained on the training data and evaluated on the test data.

Model Evaluation: After training, evaluate the model using:

1.Accuracy: Percentage of correctly classified messages.
2.Precision: How many of the messages classified as spam are actually spam.
3.Recall: How many actual spam messages were correctly classified.
4.F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
5.Confusion Matrix: A matrix showing true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for building the system.
Scikit-learn: Library used for machine learning models and preprocessing.
Pandas: Library used for data manipulation and analysis.
NLTK/Spacy: Libraries for natural language processing tasks.
Jupyter Notebook: Used for conducting experiments and testing the model.

Usage
1.Train the model: If you need to retrain the model:
python src/train.py
2.Classify new messages: Use the trained model to predict whether a message is spam or ham:
python src/classify.py --message "Your message here"


Prediction
To predict if a new message is spam or ham:

1.Input: Provide a message as input to the model.
2.Classification: The trained model processes the message and returns whether it is spam or not.
